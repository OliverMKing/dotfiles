## Information 

Manjaro is a Linux distribution and i3 is a tiling window manager. My setup was built on top of the [Manjaro i3 Community Editon](https://manjaro.org/community-editions/). The files in this repository can be used to clone my setup. 


I use the urxvt terminal emulator. The bar used is [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar). [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) is used to generate the color scheme for the setup. The GTK theme is called car and was created by me with [Oomox](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox). The Polybar background matches the theme which can be best shown in the Firefox and Terminal previews. Rofi is used as a program launcher. I use Ranger as a file manager and Vim (with the wal or default theme) as a text editor. The wallpaper originally came from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photography-of-street-during-rainy-day-1207951/) but the brightness and contrast has been adjusted.
